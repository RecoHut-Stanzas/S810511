        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Session-based recommendation tasks are performed based on the user's anonymous historical behavior sequence and implicit feedback data, such as clicks, browsing, purchasing, etc., rather than rating or comment data. The primary aim is to predict the next behavior based on a sequence of the historical sequence of the session. Session-based recommendation aims to predict which item a user will click next, solely based on the user’s current sequential session data without access to the long-term preference profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "The input to these systems are time-ordered logs of recorded user interactions, where the interactions are grouped into sessions. Such a session could, for example, correspond to a listening session on a music service, or a shopping session on an e-commerce site. One particularity of such approaches is that users are anonymous, which is a common problem on websites that deal with first-time users or users that are not logged in. The prediction task in this setting is to predict the next user action, given only the interactions of the ongoing session. Today, session-based recommendation is a highly active research area due to its practical relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Markov chains is a classic case, which assumes that the next action is based on the previous ones. Many sequential recommendation methods based on the Markov chain (MC) model predict the next item based on the previous one through computing transition probabilities between two consecutive items. FPMC models the sequence behavior between every two adjacent clicks and provides a more accurate prediction for each sequence by factoring the user's personalized probability transfer matrix. The main problem with Markov methods, however, is that they assume too strongly the independence of more than two consecutive actions, so a great number of important sequential information cannot be well exploited for sessions with more than two actions.\n",

These purchase histories record transactions for each customer and detail the items that were purchased in each transaction. This is a bit different from a browsing history, as it does not contain the order of items clicked while perusing the website; it only includes the items that were eventually purchased in each transaction. However, the transactions are ordered in time, so we can treat a customer’s full transaction history as a session. Instead of predicting recommendations for what a customer might click on next, we’ll be predicting recommendations for what that customer might actually buy next. Session definitions are flexible, and care must be taken in order to properly interpret the results.\n",

Once trained, the output layer is usually discarded, and the hidden layer (also known as the embeddings) is used for downstream processes.

Word2vec will crunch over the entire corpus, learning relationships between products in the context of user browsing behavior. The result will be a collection of embeddings: one for each product. The idea is that these learned product embeddings will contain more information than a simple heuristic, and training the word2vec algorithm is typically faster and easier than training more complex, data-hungry deep learning algorithms.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are several libraries that make hyperparameter optimization approachable, easy, and *scalable*. For this cycle, we explored [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/index.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, Ray is a simple, universal API for building distributed applications. Atop this foundation are a handful of libraries designed to address specific machine learning challenges. [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune/index.html) provides several desirable features, including distributed hyperparameter sweep, checkpointing, and state-of-the-art hyperparameter search algorithms—all while supporting most major ML frameworks, such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our experiments, we tuned over the hyperparameters in the table above for the number of trials specified. Each trial was trained for 100 epochs and was evaluated on the validation set using Recall@10. This resulted in the best hyperparameter configuration for the Online Retail Data Set.\n",

        "## Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "For a sequence containing n interactions, we use the first (n-1) items in that sequence as part of the model training set. We randomly sample (n-1th, nth) pairs from these sequences for the validation and test sets. For prediction, we use the last item in the training sequence (the n-1th item) as the query item, and predict the K closest items to the query item using cosine similarity between the vector representations. We can then evaluate with the following metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Recall at *K* (Recall@*K*)** defined as the proportion of cases in which the ground truth item is among the top *K* recommendations for all test cases (that is, a test example is assigned a score of 1 if the *n*th item appears in the list, and 0 otherwise).\n",
        "- **Mean Reciprocal Rank at *K* (MRR@*K*)**, takes the average of the reciprocal ranks of the ground truth items within the top *K* recommendations for all test cases (that is, if the *n*th item was second in the list of recommendations, its reciprocal rank would be 1/2). This metric measures and favors higher ranks in the ordered list of recommendation results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy, however, is not the only relevant factor when it comes to recommendations. Depending on the problem, we may want to measure how diverse the recommendations are, or if our algorithm generally tends to recommend most popular items. These additional quality metrics, known as coverage (or diversity) and popularity bias, could help us better understand the potential side-effects of the recommender model.\n",
        "\n",
        "We trained a word2vec model using the best hyperparameters found above, which resulted in a Recall@10 score of 25.18±0.19 on the validation set, and 25.21±.26 for the test set.

        "### Model comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we’ve learned the best hyperparameters for our dataset, we can start looking at some model comparisons. We trained models using both our best hyperparameters and the default hyperparameters, each for 100 epochs. The number of epochs is another important parameter, and the default in Gensim’s implementation is five. So we trained another default word2vec model with only five epochs. Finally, we’ve shown the “Association Rules” baseline, a simple heuristic that predicts recommendations based on frequent co-occurrence between items.\n",

        "Offline evaluations rarely inform us about the quality of recommendations **as perceived by the users**. In one study of e-commerce session-based recommenders, it was observed that offline evaluation metrics often fall short because they tend to reward an algorithm when they predict the exact item that the user clicked or purchased. In real life, though, there are identical products that could potentially make equally good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we suggest incorporating human feedback on the recommendations from offline evaluations before conducting A/B tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommender systems have become a cornerstone of online life; they help us navigate an overwhelming amount of information. Being able to predict a user’s interests based on an online session is a highly relevant problem in practice. There is not, however, a one-size-fits-all model; each solution will ultimately be unique to the use case, and care must, as always, be taken in the development and assessment of the model, in order to provide recommendations that will help users and businesses alike. Careful development and assessment of any machine learning model is critical, but it is especially true with recommender systems in general, and session-based recommenders in particular. The best approach is to first benchmark several options on offline metrics (such as Recall@K), and then perform online evaluation (through A/B testing, for instance), before settling on a given model—as offline metrics typically cannot be used to properly assess real-world KPIs (like revenue generation or watch time).\n",
        "\n",
        "## What we've covered\n",
        "\n",
        "- We experimented with an NLP-based algorithm—word2vec—which is known for learning low-dimensional word representations that are contextual in nature.\n",
        "- We applied it to an e-commerce dataset containing historical purchase transactions, to learn the structure induced by both the user’s behavior and the product’s nature to recommend the next item to be purchased.\n",
        "- While doing so, we learned that hyperparameter choices are data- and task-dependent, and especially, that they differ from linguistic tasks; what works for language models does not necessarily work for recommendation tasks.\n",
        "- That said, our experiments indicate that in addition to specific parameters (like negative sampling exponent, the number of negative samples, and context window size), the number of training epochs greatly influences model performance. We recommend that word2vec be trained for as many epochs as computational resources allow, or until performance on a downstream recommendation metric has plateaued.\n",
        "- We also realized during our experimentation that performing hyperparameter search over just a handful of parameters can be time consuming and computationally expensive; hence, it could be a bottleneck to developing a real-life recommendation solution (with word2vec). While scaling hyperparameter optimization *is* possible through tools like Ray Tune, we envision additional research into algorithmic approaches to solve this problem would pave the way in developing more scalable (and less complex) solutions.\n",
